# Apna Canteen
Apna Canteen is a Canteen Management Application for University Canteens and a **Hackathon Winner** project. 
We have two Applications, User App and Admin App.

# Problem Statement

* In universities, during breaktime there is a lot of rush for food at canteen. 
* Moreover break time is limited so it is difficult for students and teachers to have their ordered food on time.

# Solution 
* We have built mobile applications that can help users to order food.
* We also have an admin app that monitors all the orders and adds or deletes various products as per availability.
